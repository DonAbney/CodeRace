## Kata Descriptions
Brief kata descriptions are provided below for convenience, as the laptops that the kata battles are taking place on are on a private network that is not connected to the internet and the katas may have been modified slightly to facilitate their use during the code battle.

### FizzBuzz
Given an integer, return a string of that number, except if the number is a multiple of 3, in which case return "Fizz", or if the number is a multiple of 5, in which case return "Buzz".  If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, then return "FizzBuzz".

### Prime Factors
Given an integer, return an ascending list of integers containing all of the prime factors of the specified integer.

### Roman Numerals
For the code battle, convert from a Roman numeral to its integer value.

(The first part of the Roman numeral kata is often to do the converse conversion, from an Arabic representation to the Roman numerals.)
